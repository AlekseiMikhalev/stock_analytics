    "## Feature Selection for Stock Data Analysis\n",
    "This notebook contains analysis of sample stock data. The aim is to identify which features have highest impact on stock price\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of stock data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect and clean the data: The first step is to collect the stock data and clean it by removing missing values and correcting any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate basic metrics: Next, calculate basic metrics such as daily returns, volatility, and moving averages. These metrics can help identify trends and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform technical analysis: Technical analysis involves using various chart patterns and indicators to identify trends and predict future price movements. Some commonly used technical indicators include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perform fundamental analysis: Fundamental analysis involves analyzing a company's financial statements and other economic factors to determine its underlying value. This can include analyzing earnings reports, balance sheets, and income statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features or variables based on the existing data that can help improve the predictive power of the model. This can include lagged values of price or volume, moving averages, and technical indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular feature engineering techniques for stock datasets include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lagging and differencing: This involves creating new variables based on the previous day's price or volume. For example, a lagged variable could be yesterday's closing price or trading volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Moving averages: This involves calculating the average price or volume over a specific time period. Moving averages can help smooth out short-term fluctuations and identify trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Technical indicators: Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price and/or volume data that can help identify buy/sell signals. Some commonly used technical indicators include RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sentiment analysis: This involves analyzing news articles and social media to determine the sentiment surrounding a particular stock. This can be used to create a sentiment score that can be included as a feature in the model."
